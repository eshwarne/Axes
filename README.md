# Project AXES

Axes lets you define access of your team and service in an opinianated way and lets you oversee across tenants.

Axes solves a key problem of access management and identifies gaps (what we call axes in your acces) and presents it to you in an actionable manner.

It is important to note that Axes is a client only tool and does not persist your access information to anywhere other than your local storage. You can download Axes files encrypted and share it across with friends.
